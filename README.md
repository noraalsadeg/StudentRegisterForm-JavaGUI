# StudentRegisterForm-JavaGUI
for the requirements of completing the Advanced Object Oriented Programming with Java, I have developed a Student Registration Form in java with Sql extended files.

So basically I created 3 packages
1. Dao1 and consists of connectionfactory class and REgisterDAO class and student sql based 
2. Frame and consists of RegisterFrame and Validation 
3. Model and consists of Student  

and I added three external Jar files 
1. mysql-connector-jar-5.1.14-bin.jar – To connect Java program with MySql Database 
2. jBCrypt-0.4.jar – To encrypt password 
3. jdatepicker-1.3.4.jar– To include date picker in Jframe
